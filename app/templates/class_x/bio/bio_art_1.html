    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>
        In unicellular organisms, cell division is the means of reproduction; in multicellular organisms, it is the means of tissue growth and maintenance. Survival of the eukaryotes depends upon interactions between many cell types, and it is essential that a balanced distribution of types be maintained. This is achieved by the highly regulated process of cell proliferation. The growth and division of different cell populations are regulated in different ways, but the basic mechanisms are similar throughout multicellular organisms.

    <h2>Mitosis</h2>
    <h3>
        One cell gives rise to two genetically identical daughter cells during the process of mitosis.
        Most tissues of the body grow by increasing their cell number, but this growth is highly regulated to maintain a balance between different tissues. In adults most cell division is involved in tissue renewal rather than growth, many types of cells undergoing continuous replacement. Skin cells, for example, are constantly being sloughed off and replaced; in this case, the mature differentiated cells do not divide, but their population is renewed by division of immature stem cells. In certain other cells, such as those of the liver, mature cells remain capable of division to allow growth or regeneration after injury.
        In contrast to these patterns, other types of cells either cannot divide or are prevented from dividing by certain molecules produced by nearby cells. As a result, in the adult organism, some tissues have a greatly reduced capacity to renew damaged or diseased cells. Examples of such tissues include heart muscle, nerve cells of the central nervous system, and lens cells in mammals. Maintenance and repair of these cells is limited to replacing intracellular components rather than replacing entire cells.

    <h2>Duplication of the genetic material</h2>
    <h3>
        Before a cell can divide, it must accurately and completely duplicate the genetic information encoded in its DNA in order for its progeny cells to function and survive. This is a complex problem because of the great length of DNA molecules. Each human chromosome consists of a long double spiral, or helix, each strand of which consists of more than 100 million nucleotides
The duplication of DNA is called DNA replication, and it is initiated by complex enzymes called DNA polymerases. These progress along the molecule, reading the sequences of nucleotides that are linked together to make DNA chains. Each strand of the DNA double helix, therefore, acts as a template specifying the nucleotide structure of a new growing chain. After replication, each of the two daughter DNA double helices consists of one parental DNA strand wound around one newly synthesized DNA strand
In order for DNA to replicate, the two strands must be unwound from each other. Enzymes called helicases unwind the two DNA strands, and additional proteins bind to the separated strands to stabilize them and prevent them from pairing again. In addition, a remarkable class of enzyme called DNA topoisomerase removes the helical twists by cutting either one or both strands and then resealing the cut. These enzymes can also untangle and unknot DNA when it is tightly coiled into a chromatin fibre.
In the circular DNA of prokaryotes, replication starts at a unique site called the origin of replication and then proceeds in both directions around the molecule until the two processes meet, producing two daughter molecules. In rapidly growing prokaryotes, a second round of replication can start before the first has finished. The situation in eukaryotes is more complicated, as replication moves more slowly than in prokaryotes. At 500 to 5,000 nucleotides per minute (versus 100,000 nucleotides per minute in prokaryotes), it would take a human chromosome about a month to replicate if started at a single site. Actually, replication begins at many sites on the long chromosomes of animals, plants, and fungi. Distances between adjacent initiation sites are not always the same; for example, they are closer in the rapidly dividing embryonic cells of frogs or flies than in adult cells of the same species.

    <h2>Mitosis and cytokinesis</h2>
    <h3>
        In eukaryotes the processes of DNA replication and cell division occur at different times of the cell division cycle. During cell division, DNA condenses to form short, tightly coiled, rodlike chromosomes. Each chromosome then splits longitudinally, forming two identical chromatids. Each pair of chromatids is divided between the two daughter cells during mitosis, or division of the nucleus, a process in which the chromosomes are propelled by attachment to a bundle of microtubules called the mitotic spindle.
        Mitosis can be divided into five phases. In prophase the mitotic spindle forms and the chromosomes condense. In prometaphase the nuclear envelope breaks down (in many but not all eukaryotes) and the chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle. Both chromatids of each chromosome attach to the spindle at a specialized chromosomal region called the kinetochore. In metaphase the condensed chromosomes align in a plane across the equator of the mitotic spindle. Anaphase follows as the separated chromatids move abruptly toward opposite spindle poles. Finally, in telophase a new nuclear envelope forms around each set of unraveling chromatids.
        An essential feature of mitosis is the attachment of the chromatids to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. This ensures that each of the daughter cells will receive a complete set of chromosomes. The mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules, each of which is a tubular assembly of molecules of the protein tubulin .Some microtubules extend from one spindle pole to the other, while a second class extends from one spindle pole to a chromatid. Microtubules can grow or shrink by the addition or removal of tubulin molecules. The shortening of spindle microtubules at anaphase propels attached chromatids to the spindle poles, where they unravel to form new nuclei
        The two poles of the mitotic spindle are occupied by centrosomes, which organize the microtubule arrays. In animal cells each centrosome contains a pair of cylindrical centrioles, which are themselves composed of complex arrays of microtubules. Centrioles duplicate at a precise time in the cell division cycle, usually close to the start of DNA replication.
        After mitosis comes cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. This is another process in which animal and plant cells differ. In animal cells cytokinesis is achieved through the constriction of the cell by a ring of contractile microfilaments consisting of actin and myosin, the proteins involved in muscle contraction and other forms of cell movement. In plant cells the cytoplasm is divided by the formation of a new cell wall, called the cell plate, between the two daughter cells. The cell plate arises from small Golgi-derived vesicles that coalesce in a plane across the equator of the late telophase spindle to form a disk-shaped structure. In this process, each vesicle contributes its membrane to the forming cell membranes and its matrix contents to the forming cell wall. A second set of vesicles extends the edge of the cell plate until it reaches and fuses with the sides of the parent cell, thereby completely separating the two new daughter cells. At this point, cellulose synthesis commences, and the cell plate becomes a primary cell wall.

    <h2>Meiosis</h2>
    <h3>
        A specialized division of chromosomes called meiosis occurs during the formation of the reproductive cells, or gametes, of sexually reproducing organisms. Gametes such as ova, sperm, and pollen begin as germ cells, which, like other types of cells, have two copies of each gene in their nuclei. The chromosomes composed of these matching genes are called homologs. During DNA replication, each chromosome duplicates into two attached chromatids. The homologous chromosomes are then separated to opposite poles of the meiotic spindle by microtubules similar to those of the mitotic spindle. At this stage in the meiosis of germ cells, there is a crucial difference from the mitosis of other cells. In meiosis the two chromatids making up each chromosome remain together, so that whole chromosomes are separated from their homologous partners. Cell division then occurs, followed by a second division that resembles mitosis more closely in that it separates the two chromatids of each remaining chromosome. In this way, when meiosis is complete, each mature gamete receives only one copy of each gene instead of the two copies present in other cells.
